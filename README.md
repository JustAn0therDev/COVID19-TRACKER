# COVID19-TRACKER

Due to the COVID-19 events, this react app was made with the intention of letting people know about the most recent confirmed cases for various countries. The original API that I am consuming data from can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/KishCom/api/covid-19-coronavirus-statistics/details). All credits of the data goes to the creator of the API, I just want to help you by providing information about the COVID-19 cases an easier way.

Another simple [Windows Application project was made using C#](https://github.com/JustAn0therDev/boomerremover/) first but I didn't want people to have the trouble of installing or not being able to use the application on a different OS. If you have any ideas for features or bugs, you can either create a Pull Request or open and issue.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
